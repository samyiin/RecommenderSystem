I am currently on stage (1), and I plan to use Grobid's code.
https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid

Install Grobid need to install wget, install wget need to install homebrew, takes forever
Also have to install JVM8 (my JVM16 doesn't work), and set it to be my default jdk

met trouble: my computer is M1 chip
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73633050/installing-jvm-8-on-mac-with-m1-chip
met trouble: when running ./gradlew run
gradlew8.0 doesn't support some features, it's out of my ability to configure it now.

So I will try to use batch mode, doesn't support multithreading thou...
When using the batch mode, met problem: XXX commend not found. Solved by:
(1) find java executable's path: which java
(2) add this path to $PATH: source <path_to_shell_config_file>

Still met problem: seems to do with x86_64 chip and arm64 chip.
Try to run it on QEMU virtual machine that emulate x86_64.
https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-use-qemu-to-boot-another-os/
Met problem: no bootable device
Solve: ubuntu iso image have problem, go to official website
Met Problem: Stuck at install Ubuntu selection
Solve: must give more memory: "-m 2G" at least
Met Problem: progressed a bit, and then still stuck
Give up on emulation now.

Try aquarium computer now...
It worked, should have started with that...
Now do client:
Met problem: Try to setup.py install, but aquarium computer don't allow setup
Solve: Used a python virtual machine
Met problem: Try to use "grobid --input ....", got permission denied
Solve: sudo, but it's aquarium computer, can't sudo

Try batch mode for aquarium computer......
Met problem: java: File exists. It runs but there is no return. And my original pdf is gone
So far, give up Grobid, look for a new way.

Failed too many times. Could work on a normal x86_64 computer, not working now.
I can't solve the problem now. Give up on this embedding for now.


=======2023.May.7=======
Today tried to use GPT2, everything works so far...
Used PyPDF2 to read the pdf into a single string
Met Problem: if I am feeding to gpt2 a whole research paper's string, it will exceed the max number of words.
Solution: Truncate into small segments, but the time it takes is huge. Let's try to just find the authors and title.
Met Problem: GPT2's response doesn't seem to be correct, it is indeed a response
Solution: Give up gpt2, next plan
Also GPT's information extraction is too slow, aborted

https://github.com/CeON/CERMINE
Try using standalone app
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/pl.edu.icm.cermine/cermine-impl/1.13
It works!!!!!! OMG should have started with this. All we needs to do is just download the jar file, and use the prompt.
Use -output zone, will parse the paper into all the sections with labels like title and stuff.

Shortcut: enter /CERMINE/ directory, then type this:
java -cp cermine-impl-1.13-jar-with-dependencies.jar pl.edu.icm.cermine.ContentExtractor -outputs zones -path ../../papers_pdf

=======2023.May.9=======
Now that everything works, we still need some post processing, like changing '\n' to ' ' etc.
Including:
    Removing special characters
    Removing stop words
    Converting to lowercase
    Stemming or lemmatization
    Handling contractions
    Removing HTML tags or other irrelevant details
    Handling special characters
Should this be the responsibility of paper reader (post processing) or embedding methods (preprocessing?)?
I think half half, hard to tell, some of them is the paper reader's, some is specific to the embedder.
I will provide as functionality of the paper readers.

One thing might need to change later: now we are placing papers under a directory, and later we might have a data base,
then we will have to change it to query form the database.

Met Problem and Solution: if want os.system to run "cd" cmd, must pay attention to cwd. cuz if you are running another
 file that called this method, then the cwd is not the same. So run two commend at the same os.system(), separate with
  ";" so that it will only open one terminal two run both the command.

*******  First edition summarize     ********
*******                              ********
*********************************************
In the first edition, I only setup one main way to read pdf into attribute dict, CERMINE. And CERMINE will label the
file into "zones", aka things such as "title", "author", "reference" etc. And I will return the paper as one single
 string, so the returned attribute dictionary of the paper will have only one attribute: "content". Later we might need
 to parse this single string into many strings for each attributes such as "title", "author", "citation", etc.
But I feel like I need to at least extract the title of the paper from it for the database in first edition.
And later Title + author for used based filtering, title + author + citation for item based filtering...
