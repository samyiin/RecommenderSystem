The first goal is to set up a simple content based recommender system.
My first approach is:
(1) convert a research paper pdf into meta datas
(2) embed these meta datas into vector using openAI's embedding service
(3) recommend to user using similarity of the vectors

Spent the whole day trying to use grobid, didn't work in the end. look at MY_LOG under grobid.

The next possibility is GPT model.
