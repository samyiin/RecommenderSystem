The first goal is to set up a simple content based recommender system.
My first approach is:
(1) convert a research paper pdf into meta datas
(2) embed these meta datas into vector using openAI's embedding service
(3) recommend to user using similarity of the vectors

I am currently on stage (1), and I plan to use Grobid's code.
https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid
Install Grobid need to install wget, install wget need to install homebrew, takes
forever
Also have to install JVM8 (my JVM16 doesn't work), and set it to be my default jdk

met trouble: my computer is M1 chip
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73633050/installing-jvm-8-on-mac-with-m1-chip
met trouble: when running ./gradlew run
gradlew8.0 doesn't support some features, it's out of my ability to configure it now.

So I will try to use batch mode, doesn't support multithreading thou...
When using the batch mode, met problem: XXX commend not found. Solved by:
(1) find java executable's path: which java
(2) add this path to $PATH: source <path_to_shell_config_file>

Still met problem: seems to do with x86_64 chip and arm64 chip.
Try to run it on QEMU virtual machine that emulate x86_64.

Met problem: no bootable device
Solve: ubuntu iso image have problem, go to official website
Met Problem: Stuck at install Ubuntu selection
Solve: must give more memory: "-m 2G" at least
Met Problem: progressed a bit, and then still stuck
Give up on emulation now.

Try aquarium computer now...
It worked, should have started with that
