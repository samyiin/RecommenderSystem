download all papers in field "machine learning"
seems like there is a new way of embedding, called specture embedding, and semantic scholar is using it
Seems like semantic scholar also have a recommender system, and can also be user based + user can claim an author...

Here is what I am going to do:
1. Download raw file, with title, authors, and then feature_1, feature_2, ...., feature_x.
<- which features to select?
So far:
Identifier: paperId,corpusId,title,authors,
ForEmbedding: tldr,abstract,embedding,
FeaturesForRank: publicationDate,referenceCount,citationCount,influentialCitationCount



<- bulk download is faster than download from request. But bulk download is too broad.
How about add fieldsOfStudy, and filter by computer science

I. Redo what I did in first edition, but this time with database
    1. give each paper embeddings and store to database
    <- which embedding to use? So far just use tldr, and set up possibilities for openAI
    2. establish a user table based on paper table, user still represented by authorId, and average of embeddings/<
    3. Select a user, query database based on embedding cosine similarity, and update user embedding./<


II. Do aviv's suggestion: query database based on certain feature, here cited number
    1. Query the database based on feature_x, and return the top n recommendation.

III. establish a linear model
