=======2023.May.6=======

I am currently on stage (1), and I plan to use Grobid's code.
https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid

Install Grobid need to install wget, install wget need to install homebrew, takes forever
Also have to install JVM8 (my JVM16 doesn't work), and set it to be my default jdk

met trouble: my computer is M1 chip
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73633050/installing-jvm-8-on-mac-with-m1-chip
met trouble: when running ./gradlew run
gradlew8.0 doesn't support some features, it's out of my ability to configure it now.

So I will try to use batch mode, doesn't support multithreading thou...
When using the batch mode, met problem: XXX commend not found. Solved by:
(1) find java executable's path: which java
(2) add this path to $PATH: source <path_to_shell_config_file>

Still met problem: seems to do with x86_64 chip and arm64 chip.
Try to run it on QEMU virtual machine that emulate x86_64.

Met problem: no bootable device
Solve: ubuntu iso image have problem, go to official website
Met Problem: Stuck at install Ubuntu selection
Solve: must give more memory: "-m 2G" at least
Met Problem: progressed a bit, and then still stuck
Give up on emulation now.

Try aquarium computer now...
It worked, should have started with that...
Now do client:
Met problem: Try to setup.py install, but aquarium computer don't allow setup
Solve: Used a python virtual machine
Met problem: Try to use "grobid --input ....", got permission denied
Solve: sudo, but it's aquarium computer, can't sudo

Try batch mode for aquarium computer......
Met problem: java: File exists. It runs but there is no return. And my original pdf is gone
So far, give up Grobid, look for a new way.

Failed too many times. Could work on a normal x86_64 computer, not working now.
I can't solve the problem now. Give up on this embedding for now.
